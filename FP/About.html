                <p>Hi! Welcome to my personal portfolio page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   I am currently a junior double majoring in Business Administration and Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon
                   University. I am passionate about the intersection between business and technology and wish to pursue a career path 
                   in Consulting or Product Management. I think my biggest strength is my ability to connect people from diverse backgrounds
                   together. I grew up in China and came to the U.S for high school and college and I just find myself really enjoying talking 
                   with people from diverse cultural background and learn about their stories.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   To leverage my strengths and practice my leadership skills, I am actively involved in many leadership positions on campus.
                   I serve as VP Finance for Chinese Student Association where I am responsible for seeking sponors for funding and other 
                   organizations for partnership. I am also Vice President for CMU Summit where we invite alumins from different industries to
                   talk to current students about their career journey and industry insights. Apart from these, I was also able to step outside
                   of my comfort zone and become one of the few international students in the school's premium business co-ed fraternity Alpha 
                   Kappa Psi where I met similar minded peers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  This summer, I will be working as a Business Product Analyst intern at Santander Bank where I will assist the Digital
                  Transformation team to better their online banking platform. I am really excited about this opportunity and can't wait 
                  for summer to start! </p>
